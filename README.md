# wonderfoon-light
A Wonderfoon is a rotary dial phone that is converted into a jukebox.

The original Wonderfoon plays music tracks on dialing a number, from a small mp3 player (DF Player) that is controlled by either an Arduino, Wemos, Raspberry Pi, ESP8266 or any programmable board. 

This Light version starts playing random music tracks as soon as the speaker is picked up. No settings, no config, just playing random tracks when picked up. This way there is only need for 4 ordinary gpio pins, so it can be done with almost any nano board.

More info on the original Wonderfoon can be found on both http://www.wonderfoon.nl/ (the inventor) and https://www.wonderfoon.eu/ (the community)
